## General style guidelines

### Link, link, link!
If possible, provide a link to the project's website, Steam page, forum thread or whatever else. Use the standard Markdown style to make the project title a clickable link that redirects to the page in question.

### Sort by alphabetical order
Projects should be sorted in alphabetical order. Please take care to submit your suggested additions in correct alphabetical order. Ignore first-word articles "a", "an", "the" in the sorting.

### Series
Series with several entries should be listed on a single bullet-point line in order of appearance (oldest to newest). In cases where the entries share parts of the title, full titles do not have to be provided. Use commas (**,**) and ampersands (**&**) to separate the entries according to the guide below:
* Only 2 entries in a series: **&**
* All entries except the last 2 in series with more than 2 entries: **,**
* Last 2 entries in series with more than 2 entries: **&**
